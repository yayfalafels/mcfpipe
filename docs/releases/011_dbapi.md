# Database API
This release covers the setup of Database API on AWS

## Situation

## Objectives and Aims

## Scope
The current scope includes the **Database API**, deployed via CICD Github Action

- **CICD** github deploy action workflows
- **Database** DynamoDB tables from schema
- **DB API** API Gateway + Lambda functions
- **Tester** Tester fargate container to validate the DB API

## AWS Infrastructure
The AWS infrastructure is organized into layered CloudFormation stacks, segregated by function and coupled through the repository via parameters and configuration files.

__Cloudformation stacks__
Cloudformation stack layers

| id | stack | purpose | resources |
| - | - | - | - |
| 01 | networking | network and VPC for public and private subnets | VPC, subnets, security groups, internet gateway |
| 02 | database | storage database and connector API | DynamoDB tables |
| 03 | webscraper | serverless Fargate compute resource for Webscraper | Fargate compute tasks |

__AWS CLI__
Additional resources created outside of the cloudformation stack either manually from local PC or via Github actions. 

These resources must be deleted in a separate cleanup workflow.

_manual setup resources_

| id | resource | executor | sequence |
| - | - | - | - |
| 01 | S3 bucket | Github Action | initial setup |
| 02 | S3 config | Github Action | initial setup after s3 bucket creation |
| 03 | ECR Dockerimages | Github Action | before the stack they are used in |

## Database API

## Github Action Workflows
CICD to deploy each of the stacks are orchestrated via Github Actions 

| id | workflow | app feature | description |
| - | - | - | - |
| 01 | network | initial setup and network | initial setup, create S3 bucket, global IAM roles, network infrastructure |
| 02 | db api | database api | load database schema, deploy database dynamodb tables and db api stack, upload db api config ex API URL |
| 03 | tester | tester | create docker image for tester Fargate container image, deploy tester stack and upload tester config for SSH access ex tester instance_id |
| 01 | webscraper | webscraper | create docker image |
